            <p>My capstone project covers a site in Langley, Washington called Lone Lake. For the past decade Lone Lake has experienced toxic cyanobacterial blooms that could pose harm to the human, animal, and ecosystem health. This will be a review of scholarly journal entries that demonstrate that Geographic Information Systems’ (GIS) utility for lake managers and limnologist. GIS as a tool kit can help lake managers conceptualize and analyze the natural and manmade, the concrete and the abstract, which helps us better understand our sites and approach management with nuance.</p>
            <p>Bohlen, C., & Lewis, L. Y. (2009). Examining the economic impacts of hydropower dams on property values using GIS. Journal of Environmental Management, 90, S258–S269. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.07.026">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.07.026</a></p>
            <p>In this paper Curtis and Lewis utilize GIS to analyze the long term impact of dam removal on property value in the Kennebec and Penobscot River Basins in Maine. The data for both river basins came from the US census, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, and the Enhanced 911 information made public by the state of Maine. These for datasets contained information about population density and income, geospatial location of dams, and for the home address and property values respectively. GIS was used to first observe property proximity to the waterfront, then to conduct a hedonic pricing assessment to see the impact, if any, on property value. The dam removal is expressed positively through a hedonic pricing equation and has positive impacts on property value. The authors found that on average waterfront owners in the basin paid 16 percent more than the surrounding area. </p>
            <p>This research, though focusing on rivers, presents a method through GIS able to analyze the potential impact of the harmful cyanobacterial blooms on property values over time. As the blooms become more and more severe, there may be potential negative expression on hedonic pricing which decreases property value. I hope to recreate the assessment done in this study on property in the watershed surrounding Lone Lake and compare the average price index of property value for parcels directly on the lake.</p>

            <p>This paper covered a survey of 89 administrators of fishery management agencies and 63 percent believed that GIS was very useful or extremely useful. This is a very power tool for anyone trying to better understand an ecosystem. However, this usefulness according to most administrators is limited by the fact that only a few individuals within the agencies themselves know how to use the software. This requires a diversity of users so that the full potential of programs can be used by many. Biologist, managers, and administrators all bring something to the table when it comes to the use of this software.</p>

            <p>The creation of DRASTIC attribute layers aid in the project the vulnerability of aquifers to nitrate of 13 points in the Caspian Sea aquifers around Tehran, Iran. DRASTIC is an acronym for a set of parameters to analyze water quality. It stands for Depth to water from soil surface (in meters); Recharge Net (in millimeters); Aquifer Media; Soil Media; Topography (in slope percentages); Impact of vadose zone media; Conductivity of Aquifer (in meters per day). These parameters were modified by using nitrates as a control, instead of other nutrients and overlaid them in a digital elevation model to display the depth at which the nitrate concentration. This could be useful for a lake manager especially at Lone Lake because of the many agricultural operations that may be adding additional phosphorus or nitrogen into the lake from pesticide use.</p>

Using fine-scale GIS data to assess the relationship between intra-annual environmental niche variability and population density in a local stream fish assemblage. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2(3), 303–311. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00076.x">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00076.x</a></p>
            <p>The researchers in this paper compare the variability between in the niche characteristics in species and the habitat which they live in. Using GIS to compare the ranges of habitats and multivariate environmental data with the abundance of the eleven species in this area. The researchers find that during colder periods distribution of habitat is a strong predictor of variation in population density among the 11 species. Throughout the rest of the year they can be found together at different environments. This is useful for lake managers who work with fishing and wildlife agencies who want to better understand the relationship of the native and stocked fish in the lake.

Past changes in the Scots pine forest line and climate in Finnish Lapland; a study based on megafossils, lake sediments, and GIS-based vegetation and climate data. Holocene (Sevenoaks), 16(3), 381–391. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hl934rp">https://doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hl934rp</a></p>
            <p>The researchers using GIS to spatially interpolate the data which quantified the distribution of pines in Finnish Lapland. The data sets were digital elevation models using 25 meter grid squares, climate data, and nature inventory from cores taken from lake sediment. This model allowed the researchers to observe the range of the forest stands over the course of centuries and several climatic periods. In the case of Lone Lake, this is a useful method in analyzing the historic vegetation. This can be useful in observing the lakes climatic shifts and potentially analyze the impact of increased solar input on cyanobacterial blooms at different depths of the lake through the concentration of cyanobacteria in the cores taken from the bed of the lake.</p>

            <p>The researchers using echo sounder equipped with a differential GPS made underwater DEM of a river. Sediment samples analyzed for carbon content and properties were used to display the carbon storage in the river bed in the bathymetric levels. Though this is another paper researching rivers, the methodology to make a DEM will help managers remake older bathymetric maps.</p>

Evaluation of spatial correlation between nutrient exchange rates and benthic biota in a reef-flat ecosystem by GIS-assisted flow-tracking. Journal of Oceanography, 63(4), 643–659. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10872-007-0057-y">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10872-007-0057-y</a></p>
            <p>The researchers use GIS to track the spatial correlation between nitrates, nitrites, ammonia and phosphate exchange and benthic biota on the reefs around Ishigaki Island. Using GIS and GPS to organize the information were used to collect and record outflows of nutrients and the concentration of nutrients to the reefs into data points. GIS was also used to position vegetation maps to correlate them with the geospatial location of reefs. The researchers observe that areas with lower benthic biota threshold have less ability to absorb the different nutrients. In a lake that is a closed system with nutrients flowing in and out, this method of flow tracking would be really helpful in creating a nutrient budget. Especially, in very productive lakes.</p>

            <p>Moawad in this paper use old the projections from Soviet and US military maps to detect underwater topography in the Red Sea Coast. The two projections have gaps, and, when overlaid, the maps reveal that continental shelf is influenced by a probable fault line. They also found extinct volcanos, sub-basins, and sea ridges. This is helpful for finding new submerged topography of a lake that may have outdated bathymetry, which Lone Lake does.</p>

North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 35(1), 141–157. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2014.977471">https://doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2014.977471</a></p>
            <p>The researchers Nohner and Diana in northern Wisconsin used GIS to analyze 28 lakes for prioritization of spawning Muskellunge. By selecting the characteristics of Muskellunge spawning areas as a set of parameters to search, the conditions throughout a shoreline and soil composition of the 28 lakes were selected via attribute. The model found that 32 percent of the sites were acceptable spawning habitat. This could be helpful for lake managers so they can calculate the best place where trout to be spawned to ensure another fish kill will not happen in Lone Lake.</p>
            <p>Pavich, S. M. (1999). Using GIS to analyze the relationships between open space and property values. Oregon State University.</p>
            <p>This paper is very similar to the Bohlen & Lewis paper, however the paper utilizes a buffer analysis to measure areas to test the hedonic value increase of open space which includes areas that lead to the lake. The study is done in the Lake Tahoe Basin and finds that the property value is also higher but this correlates with these higher area. Pavich uses another hedonic model. The analysis found that open space is less valuable because of the amount of public open space that is available to land owners. Areas with 100 and 500 to 2000 meter buffer of open space was found to impact the property value negatively in this watershed as well.</p>

A LIDAR, GIS and basic spatial statistic application for the study of ravine and palaeo-ravine evolution in the upper Vipava Valley, SW Slovenia. Geomorphology (Amsterdam, Netherlands), 204, 638–645. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.09.010">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.09.010</a></p>
            <p>The researchers use GIS software and historical LIDAR imagery to the map out the growth of a ravine over thousands of years. The LIDAR imagery allowed the researchers to analyze the slope and direction of ravines that form the palaeo-ravine. The use of high resolution airborne LIDAR is a very powerful tool to spot flows into bodies of water in spite of vegetation from normal aerial photography. This can help a lake manager find all potential inflows in a lake even those on developed land.</p>

            <p>The researchers used a multibeam bathymetric survey to see the sources of the basin a measuring the outflow sections going out in the Irrawaddy Delta. The bathymetric analysis found that there was a submarine channeled under the west basin and the modelling allowed for the researchers to overlay the submarine channels with existing channels known to found the source and correlated it with soil types that led to the formation of the submarine channels.</p>

            <p>The researcher used GIS to track the source of in-lake nutrient inputs and analyze the impact of watershed loading. The researchers used depths of the lake inlets and the soil composition to create geospatial data which allowed a phosphorus budget to be taken for Lake Taihu. This is very important for Lone Lake due to its excess of phosphorus in the lake that has fueled the cyanobacterial blooms, causing toxins to accumulate in the lake. This research paper shows how a lake manager can use GIS to monitor phosphorus incoming into lakes.</p>

            <p>Wilcox and Xie used GIS to analyze to reaction of wetland plants on Lake Ontario to changes in water table and lake levels via regulations. This study takes an index of wetland plants and compares their positions from 1918 to 2000 and compare them to changes in the bathymetric maps across Lake Ontario. They then analyze how these changes in water position effect the state. The researcher’s findings were used in the International Joint Commission between Canada and the US to recommend the regulations of water release and retention.</p>

            <p>This paper uses GIS to create an ecological risk index at Poyang Lake. The data layers represent points on the land around the lake. The index assigns a value to different characteristics of the land centered on concentrations for nutrient input of total phosphorus and total nitrogen. This research finds that non-point source pollution in the canal areas was the source of total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations. This non-point source pollution is very much a focus for many lakes and can contribute the eutrophication of a lake, especially in urban areas.</p>

            <p>The researchers in this paper use GIS bathymetric mapping and data collection. They also used the distribution of chlorophyll-a levels. This mapping allows the researchers to see where these concentrations in a location with different submarine mapping points. The areas where the high concentrations of chlorophyll-a coincided with the areas and depths that generated cyanobacteria blooms. The researchers use the nutrients data over time to simulate how Wuhan East Lake experienced eutrophication overtime, and that mainly these blooms were occurring at the epimolimnon and metalimnion where outfalls where close.</p>

            <p>The research team used a GIS model to observe the aquatic soil type for juvenile fisheries. This was used by the traits of each lake across Minnesota. The flowchart of their model allows them to create a workflow manager that allows a series geoprocessing which pairs down the data to test different parameters until the selections for optimal habitat for walleye and smallmouth and largemouth bass. The researcher finds that every lake has habitat that these species can use and that the lake themselves are all potential for fisheries to exist without stocking. This is vital for fisheries which all the public lakes in Island County because of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife stocking the lakes with juveniles and allowing a natural life cycle.</p>
