                        <p>Lone Lake is eutrophic and annually produces harmful cyanobacteria blooms that release high levels of anatoxin-a and microcystin. These toxin concentrations have exceeded state standards every year since 2015. Washington State toxin concentrations for “unsafe” lake use are greater than or equal to eight micrograms per liter and greater or equal to one microgram per liter for microcystin and anatoxin-a, respectively. Lone Lake’s concentrations of toxins during its annual bloom range anywhere from 250 to 500 microgram per liter for microcystin and 10 to 120 micrograms per liter for anatoxin-a. In Lone Lake these concentrations can persist from a few weeks to four months.
                            Harmful cyanobacteria blooms (also called cyanoHABs) are an emerging public health concern. As freshwater sources experience concentrated nutrient loads from both natural and anthropogenic sources of pollution, the world has seen a staggering increase of algae and algae related toxins. These toxins are deadly to domestic animals and are harmful to humans. Microcystin is a toxin that attacks liver tissue and has devastating effects on mammals. According to the Sivonen & Jones paper (51999) in Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water: A Guide to Their Public Health Consequences, Monitoring and Management, the health risk to mammals in high concentrations is dangerous. “In mouse bioassays, which traditionally have been used to screen toxicity of field and laboratory samples, cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (liver toxins) cause death by liver haemorrhage within a few hours of the acute doses” (p. 55). Anatoxin-a, however, is a neurotoxin that causes the muscles to seize. In the study of Sivonen et al. (1999) using mice again, “Death by respiratory arrest occurs rapidly (within 2-30 minutes)” (p. 51). Of course, these are smaller animals (rodents), but the higher the concentrations in the lake make them dangerous to public health and the ecosystem’s welfare.
